# The wide P&L: database, structure, chart

The profit export is a wide profit-and-loss file - a couple of hundred amount
columns where a total and the lines behind it sit side by side. Nothing in the
file marks which is which. The asterisks in the header are a habit of the export,
not a guarantee, so the tooling here reads the numbers instead.

**Which file gets read.** The tools take the highest-numbered `profit_*` file
in the folder - `profit_2608_3` over `profit_2608_2` over `profit_2608_1` - so a
re-cut export needs no code change, only the file dropped in. `--file NAME`
picks a different one. Both commands print the name they chose.

Columns move between cuts, which is the point of reading the structure from the
numbers: a renamed, added or dropped column changes the tree rather than breaking
the run. A relation that no longer adds up is simply not reported, and the column
turns up under **Not part of any total** in the report.

Two commands. The first loads and analyses, the second draws.

```powershell
py tools\analyze_structure.py          # -> rawdata\sales.db, docs\structure.md, docs\structure.json
py dashboard\build_pnl.py --open       # -> dashboard\pnl_2608.html
```

## 1. The database

Every file in `rawdata\` becomes a typed SQLite table in `rawdata\sales.db`.
Columns that hold amounts are `REAL` so SQL can sum them; everything else stays
`TEXT`, because a customer number with a leading zero is not a number.

Two extra tables come with it:

| Table | What it holds |
|---|---|
| `column_map` | original header, SQL column name and type, per table |
| `structure` | the discovered relations as `parent, child, sign, ordinal` |

So the analysis is queryable too:

```sql
SELECT child, sign FROM structure WHERE parent = '*Net Sales' ORDER BY ordinal;
```

Nothing leaves the machine and no server is involved - SQLite is a single file.

## 2. What adds up to what

For every amount column the analyser looks for a set of other columns that adds
up to it **on every single row**, and keeps only what holds exactly. A relation
that is off by a cent on one row of eleven thousand is not reported.

It works in this order:

1. **The layout.** An export prints a total and then its own lines, so the block
   that follows a column is tried first. A line that is itself a total has its
   own lines skipped rather than counted twice.
2. **Two subtotals, then three.** What the layout leaves standing usually turns
   out to be a difference - net sales as gross less deductions, operating profit
   as gross margin less operating expense.
3. **Peeling.** The catch-all for a total whose lines are scattered through the
   row: take off whatever shrinks the remainder most, until nothing is left.

Two rules keep the results honest:

- **A column may not be explained by anything it is already part of.** Otherwise
  `gross sales = amt + other` gets rearranged into `amt = gross sales - other`,
  which is true and useless.
- **Columns named like identifiers are left out of the arithmetic.** A customer
  number, a material code and a Nielsen id all parse as numbers and none of them
  is an amount.

Relations found early can only draw on the subtotals known at the time, so a
final pass replaces each one with its shortest form.

The result lands in `docs\structure.md` as a tree plus a list of relations, each
with the worst gap it was checked to:

```
- `*Net Sales` = `*S.Gross Sales` - `*Sales Deduction`  (holds on all 11,573 rows, worst gap 0.0000)
```

On a 251-column, 11,573-row export the whole run takes about ten seconds.

## 3. The chart

`dashboard\build_pnl.py` turns that into one self-contained page.

| Control | What it does |
|---|---|
| the four selects | narrow every figure to an Account Name, Type, Division or Category |
| **What it is made of** | the lines the current figure is a total of, as bars |
| **click a bar** | open that line's own lines |
| the breadcrumb | step back up; the first step is a picker of the headline figures |
| **Split by** | the current figure across the members of one dimension |
| **Table** | the same numbers with their share of the total |

Blue adds to the total, orange takes away from it. Bars carry their value, so
nothing has to be read off the axis, and a figure's share of the one above it
sits beside the headline - left out where that figure is negative, since a share
of a negative total reads as nonsense.

The page needs no server and no connection: every number is embedded and
Chart.js is inlined (`--cdn` links it instead, for a much smaller file that then
needs the internet).

**The numbers travel with the file.** Everything behind the chart is readable by
anyone who opens it, in the browser or in a text editor. Sending the page is
sending the data.

## If a figure looks wrong

The build prints what it matched, and that is usually the answer:

- `N amount column(s)` - if a figure you expected is missing from the chart, it
  was read as a dimension. The name test in `is_measure` is the place to look.
- `joined: N of M rows matched a customer` - a zero here means the export does
  not carry the key the master is on, and the filters fall back to the columns
  of the profit file itself.
- `filter values:` - every value each select offers, where it came from, and
  any value the master lists that **no row of this export carries**. A name
  missing from a filter is one of two different things, and this separates them:
  the master does not know it, or it knows it and nothing was sold under it this
  month. `--find VALUE` asks the same question of one code: which column holds
  it, how often, and what the masters have for it.
- `N total(s) read straight off the layout, M column(s) left to place` - a large
  M means the export is not printed as totals-then-lines, and most of the work
  fell to the wider search.
